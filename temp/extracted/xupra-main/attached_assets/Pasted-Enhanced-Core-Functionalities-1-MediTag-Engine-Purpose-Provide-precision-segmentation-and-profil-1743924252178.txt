Enhanced Core Functionalities
1. MediTag Engine
Purpose: Provide precision segmentation and profiling of HCPs to support targeted sales strategies, incorporating prescribing data, behavioral insights, geographic information, and market influence metrics.
Industry Needs: Pharmaceutical sales teams require detailed HCP segmentation to prioritize high-value prescribers, identify key opinion leaders (KOLs), and tailor outreach based on real-world evidence (RWE). Compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) is critical, as is the ability to integrate with existing customer relationship management (CRM) systems.
Enhancements:
•	Expanded Data Inputs: Beyond prescribing patterns and engagement history, include: 
o	Geographic Data: Segment HCPs by location (e.g., urban vs. rural, specific regions) to plan regional campaigns and assess market penetration.
o	Affiliation and Network Influence: Identify HCPs’ affiliations (e.g., hospitals, academic institutions) and their influence within networks to target KOLs effectively.
o	Specialty and Sub-Specialty: Enable granular tagging (e.g., cardiologist vs. interventional cardiologist) for precise targeting.
o	Patient Demographics: Analyze the patient populations served by HCPs (e.g., age, condition prevalence) to align content with clinical needs.
o	Engagement Preferences: Tag HCPs based on preferred interaction types (e.g., digital, in-person) derived from historical data.
•	Advanced AI Features: 
o	KOL Identification: Use machine learning to score HCPs based on publication history, conference participation, and peer influence, flagging them as KOLs.
o	Influence Mapping: Generate network graphs to visualize HCP connections and influence hierarchies.
•	Visualization Tools: 
o	Geographic Mapping: Display HCP segments on an interactive map for regional insights.
o	Segment Analytics: Provide charts showing segment distribution (e.g., high-volume prescribers by specialty).
•	Compliance Integration: Add flags for HCPs with data privacy restrictions or opt-outs, ensuring regulatory adherence.
Implementation:
•	Integrate with CRM systems (e.g., Veeva, Salesforce) via APIs for seamless data import.
•	Enhance the backend to process diverse data inputs and store them securely in a scalable database.
•	Update the frontend to display new tags, filters, and visualizations (e.g., maps, network graphs).
