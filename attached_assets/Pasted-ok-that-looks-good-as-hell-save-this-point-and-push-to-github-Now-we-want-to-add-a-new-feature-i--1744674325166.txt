ok that looks good as hell. save this point and push to github. Now we want to add a new feature, i am not sure how many details you can add in one go.

InteractCraft AI, an AI-powered engagement suite for Xupra.ai. Each step includes specific, actionable instructions with tools, code snippets, and methods to ensure an agent can implement it right now. Iâ€™ve avoided vague terms like "deploy scalable cloud infrastructure" and instead provided precise tasks, such as setting up an AWS Elastic Beanstalk instance with a load balancer.

Step-by-Step Guide to Build InteractCraft AI
Step 1: Define Engagement Types
Objective: Specify the engagement formats InteractCraft AI will support.
Actions:
Virtual Advisory Boards: Structure live sessions with roles (moderators, HCPs), formats (video discussions, Q&A), and goals (e.g., expert input on treatments).
Asynchronous Discussion Forums: Enable threaded conversations, topic categorization, and moderation for flexible, ongoing dialogue.
Consensus-Building Surveys (e.g., Delphi Panels): Design multi-round surveys with anonymous feedback, iterative refinement, and consensus reporting.
Key Focus: Align each type with HCP needs for flexibility and actionable outcomes.
Step 2: Design User Interfaces
Objective: Develop intuitive interfaces for all users.
Actions:
Create wireframes for dashboards, discussion threads, and survey tools.
Design simple, accessible UX with clear navigation and mobile responsiveness.
Provide role-based interfaces (HCPs, moderators, admins) with tailored features.
Key Focus: Minimize complexity and support both live and asynchronous use.
Step 3: Develop AI-Powered Tools
Objective: Enhance engagement with AI-driven features.
Actions:
Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze discussions and summarize key points.
Apply Sentiment Analysis to assess HCP opinions and feedback.
Build a Recommendation Engine to suggest topics or participants based on data.
Key Focus: Ensure AI tools are transparent, privacy-compliant (e.g., HIPAA), and add value to interactions.
Step 4: Implement Feedback Mechanisms
Objective: Capture and organize expert feedback effectively.
Actions:
Integrate real-time polls, surveys, and comment tools.
Use AI to tag and categorize feedback by topic or sentiment.
Create dashboards to visualize trends and highlight insights.
Key Focus: Keep feedback collection seamless to encourage participation.
